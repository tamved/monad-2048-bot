# 2048 Bot for Monad Blockchain Stress Testing


An automated bot that plays 2048 at high speed while generating blockchain transactions on [Monad's 2048 implementation](https://github.com/monad-developers/2048-contracts). Designed for stress testing the Monad blockchain through continuous game interactions.

## Features

- üöÄ **High-speed gameplay** with 50ms move interval
- üß† **AI-powered moves** using Expectimax algorithm with:
  - Transposition table for memoization
  - Configurable search depth (default: 5)
  - Sophisticated board evaluation heuristics
- ‚õìÔ∏è **Automatic transaction generation** with each move
- ‚öôÔ∏è Customizable weights for board evaluation metrics
- üìä Real-time move statistics and error handling

## Installation

1. Navigate to [2048.monad.xyz](https://2048.monad.xyz/)
2. Open browser developer console (F12)
3. Paste the entire contents of `bot.js` into the console and press Enter

## Usage

The bot starts automatically after injection. Console commands:
```javascript
// Pause the bot
isRunning = false;

// Resume the bot
isRunning = true;

// Reset move counter
moveCount = 0;
```

Configuration (Edit in bot.js)

```javascript
const MOVE_INTERVAL = 50;    // Time between moves (ms)
const SEARCH_DEPTH = 5;      // AI lookahead depth

const WEIGHTS = {            // Board evaluation weights
  empty: 15,
  smoothness: 1.5,
  monotonicity: 2.0,
  maxTile: 3.0,
  position: 4.0,
  levelDifference: 1.2,
  isolation: 2.5,
  adjDiff: -0.7
};

```
